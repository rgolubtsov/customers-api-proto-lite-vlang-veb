# Customers API Lite microservice prototype :small_orange_diamond: <img src="https://vlang.io/img/v-logo.png" style="border:0;width:32px" alt="V" /> (V port)

**A daemon written in V (vlang/veb), designed and intended to be run as a microservice,
<br />implementing a special Customers API prototype with a smart yet simplified data scheme**

This repo is dedicated to develop a microservice that implements a prototype of REST API service for ordinary Customers operations like adding/retrieving a Customer to/from the database, also doing the same ops with Contacts (phone or email) which belong to a Customer account.
